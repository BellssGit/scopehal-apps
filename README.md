Refer to the "getting started" chapter of [the manual](https://www.antikernel.net/temp/ngscopeclient-manual.pdf).

## Special comments

The following standard comments are used throughout the code to indicate things that could use attention, but are
not worthy of being tracked as a GitHub issue yet.

* `//TODO`: unimplemented feature, potential optimization point, etc.
* `//FIXME`: known minor problem, temporary workaround, or something that needs to be reworked later
* `//FIXME-CXX20`: places where use of C++ 20 features would simplify the code, but nothing can be done as long as we are targeting platforms which only support C++ 17
